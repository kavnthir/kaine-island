The first steps in the scientific study of music were made by Hermann von Helmholtz in the 19th century, detailed in his main work, *On the Sensations of Tone*.
# 1.1 Pitch and Frequency 
The waveform the vibration of a tuning fork tine creates can be called a **pure tone waveform**. A pure tone waveform is periodic in nature, the frequency of the wave is representative of the pitch of that particular waveform. The larger the amplitude of the waveform the louder the sound is perceived.
## 1.1.1 Instrumental Tones
There are many different types of musical instruments such as voices, violins, pianos, flutes, and so on. The sounds that these instruments are much more complex than the ones produced by something like a tuning fork. For instruments they can be combinations of several pure tone waveforms of different frequency and amplitudes. For both the flute and piano these combinations are made up pure tone waveforms that have varying amplitude but frequencies that are positive integer multiples of 329Hz. These multiples are called the harmonics for the instrumental tones. The 329Hz in this case is called the fundamental frequency. The fundamental frequency is the basis but does not necessarily need to be the loudest/ most dominant pure tone waveform.

Generalizing the concept of fundamental frequencies to make up a particular instrumental tone we get the form of:


$v_0, 2v_0, 3v_0, 4v_0, ...$

The smallest frequency being the **fundamental frequency**, $v_0$. the other frequencies are called **overtones**. All of the frequencies are called **harmonics**.

<sub>The physical explanation for why instrumental tones contain multiple harmonics are beyond the scope of this book. For more information see Chapter 3 of *Fourier Analysis*, by James S. Walker for stringed instruments. For other instruments see  Music, Physics and Engineering, by Harry F. Olson.</sub>
